### Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on May 15, 2024

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** May 15, 2024, from 02:30 AM to 06:00 AM UTC
- **Impact:** Users experienced slow load times and intermittent 503 Service Unavailable errors on the main website. Approximately 75% of users were affected.
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured load balancer settings that led to an overwhelmed server cluster.

**Timeline:**
- **02:30 AM:** Issue detected by automated monitoring alerts indicating high response times and increased error rates.
- **02:32 AM:** On-call engineer notified via pager duty.
- **02:35 AM:** Initial investigation started; web server logs and metrics reviewed.
- **03:00 AM:** Assumption made that the database might be the bottleneck; database performance metrics checked.
- **03:15 AM:** Database appears healthy; no signs of issues. Attention shifted to network components.
- **03:30 AM:** Network traffic and load balancer logs reviewed. Found unusual traffic patterns.
- **04:00 AM:** Escalated to the network operations team for a deeper analysis of the load balancer.
- **04:30 AM:** Identified a recent configuration change in the load balancer settings that was not properly validated.
- **05:00 AM:** Reverted the load balancer configuration to the previous stable state.
- **05:15 AM:** Observed gradual recovery in response times and error rates.
- **06:00 AM:** Confirmed full resolution of the issue; all services operating normally.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. A recent change intended to optimize traffic distribution inadvertently reduced the available server pool handling the incoming requests, causing a significant overload on the active servers.
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by reverting the load balancer configuration to the previous known stable state. This restored the proper distribution of traffic across all available servers, alleviating the overload and normalizing the response times and error rates.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement a more rigorous validation process for configuration changes, including staging and pre-production environments.
  - Enhance monitoring on the load balancer to detect and alert on unusual traffic patterns and load distribution issues.
  - Improve documentation and training for engineers on the impact of load balancer settings.

- **TODO List:**
  - **Patch Load Balancer:** Ensure all load balancer instances are updated with the latest firmware and patches.
  - **Add Monitoring:** Set up detailed monitoring on load balancer configurations, including alerts for significant changes in traffic patterns.
  - **Review Configuration Procedures:** Update and enforce configuration management procedures to include peer review and automated testing.
  - **Incident Response Training:** Conduct training sessions for engineers to handle similar incidents more efficiently.
  - **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular audits of critical infrastructure components, focusing on configuration changes and their impacts.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and improve the overall resilience and reliability of our web stack.
